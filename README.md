### Usage

Run the app using the shortcut in `chrome://apps`.

## Install

#### ~~Chrome Web Store~~

Unfortunately, Google has ended support for Chrome Apps, and they can no longer be published on the Chrome Web Store.

Instead you can install the app [manually](#manual-installation).

#### Manual Installation

View the visual guide: [dark](docs/manual-install-dark.png) / [light](docs/manual-install-light.png)

1. Download and extract the latest source code from [Releases](https://github.com/nfearnley/CamDesk/releases/latest).
2. Copy `chrome://extensions/` into your Chrome address bar.
3. Turn on "Developer mode".
4. Click "Load unpacked".
5. Find the `CamDesk` folder you just extracted. You'll want the one that contains the `manifest.json` file.
6. Click "Select Folder".

After completing these steps, CamDesk should now show up in your list of installed Chrome Extensions.
